GStreamer Neural Network Inference demo for NXP i.MX Processors
===============================================================


ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
-------------------
This software demonstarates GStreamer Neural Network Inference for NXP i.MX processors.
It uses an object detection model and a pose estimation model published in the internet.
Binary distribution includes demo scripts, gstreamer plugin, TensorFlow Lite models and documents.

Demo scripts:
  /usr/bin/gstnninferencedemo-mobilenet-ssd-camera
  /usr/bin/gstnninferencedemo-mobilenet-ssd-video
  /usr/bin/gstnninferencedemo-posenet-camera
  /usr/bin/gstnninferencedemo-posenet-video

GStreamer plugin:
  /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstnninferencedemo.so

TensorFlow Lite models and documents
  /usr/share/gstnninferencedemo/*


PLATFORM
--------
This software is tested with below environment:
1) BSP
  - i.MX Linux BSP 5.4.47-2.2.0
  - i.MX Linux BSP 5.10.x
2) Boards
  - i.MX 8M Plus EVK
  - i.MX 8M Mini EVK


USAGE
-----
1) Install this package to imx-image-full rootfs, because it depends on OpenCV shared libs.
2) Boot the i.MX EVK board and login to Linux as root
3) Run below demo scripts
   - Object detection with video stream (720p30 video is recommended.)
     # gstnninferencedemo-mobilenet-ssd-video </path/to/video_file>
   - Object detection with camera stream
     # gstnninferencedemo-mobilenet-ssd-video [/dev/video?]
   - Pose estimation with video stream (720p30 video is recommended.)
     # gstnninferencedemo-posenet-video </path/to/video_file>
   - Pose estimation with camera stream
     # gstnninferencedemo-posenet-video [/dev/video?]
4) If you want to play more, modify demo scripts freely!


BUILD
-----
The commands to build this software in x86_64 linux host PC are below:
  $ tar xf gstnninferencedemo-x.y.z.tar.gz
  $ cd gstnninferencedemo-x.y.z
  $ source /opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/5.4-zeus/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure --host=aarch64-poky-linux
  $ make
